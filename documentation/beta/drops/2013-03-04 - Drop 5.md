##2013-03-04 - Drop 5: build 3.0.0.129
- Added handling of the edge blend node. They are not necessary, Lux's rendering of specular makes them redundant, but the node can link to subnodes. For example, specular maps. 
- Added handling of the Blinn node. Same as above.
- Improved and fined tuned the creation of hair mask for SSS. When using SSS for cases it's important to avoid applying SSS to eye browses and facial hair. The "hair maks" checkbox in the Skin material enabled the creation of a hair mask based on the diffuse texture. The formula has been improved greatly (thanks to Alex for providing example formula form Poser) and the results are really good. SSS that causes areas like ears and fingers to be penetrated by light and eyebrows that stay sharp, without color shift. 
- Added the ability to chose what texture feeds the hair mask. By default it's the diffuse one but now you can select any **existing** texture as a source.
- Added control over the hair mask gain.
- Added preview of the hair mask

You should see a better translation of skin textures "out of the box" with this build.
