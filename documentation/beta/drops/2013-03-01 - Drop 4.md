###Changes

- The Volumes system has been improved and expanded. There is a new field called "Absorption scale." More details about this later. What is important is that now the Volume for SSS is working and so you can adjust the SSS parameters to your liking. Please note that there is one shared volume for all SSS materials in a single object. This means, for example, that all the skin materials of V4 share the same SSS volume, no matter which material is edited. For example, if you change the "Interior color" for the face material, all the other skin materials take the same value. This is by design and A Good Thingâ„¢
- The Advanced tab is now functional. The OpenCL Group Size value is useful if you use an nVidia GPU. In that case you must set the OpenCL Group size to 64 or the scene will be completely black. The default in the Advanced tab sets it automatically to that value for each new scene.
- Infinite lights are now supported. The option to convert them to mesh lights automatically replaces an I.L. with a mesh light at 100 meters of hight.  In general infinite lights should be avoided with Lux/Reality. Their availability on Reality is only to facilitate the use of pre-made light sets designed for Poser.
- Now Reality saves data into the PZ3 file **only if the user calls the Reality GUI** on the scene.
- Good improvements in the multi-selection of materials. Also, there was a bug that caused material that are invisible to not be flagged in the Reality editor. That has been fixed as well.
- Added support for "Visible in Raytracing" which is useful to automatically disable rendering of deform manipulators
- Saving and loading of Reality data is now functional and it requires less memory
- Water material now works well. Try the water plane or use your own primitive. To have ripples the primitive must have enough geometric detail to be displaced.
- Fixed a global bug that caused the color for the ColorMath texture to be black by default. That caused several materials to be conrvertd incorrectly. Bug #632, but potentially much more widespread.
