##Drop 6

- Fixed a lot of cases where Lux complained about textures not found. This was caused by a mismatch of color/float type between textures. See my post [in the beta forums](http://preta3d.com/betaforums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=17)
- Improved conversion of several materials.
- Export progress bar now visible also in the Reality window, not only in Poser.
- Reality now compatible with Vanilla Sky and Oxygen out of the box, including SSS mats. Thank you Syyd for providing them. 
- Reality now compatible with Alicia, Auria, Sabine and Columbia,  including SSS mats. Thank you to Viktohria for providing them
- Fine-tuned values for Bump Map. Please let me know if they are working for you.
- Finished support for Glossy's top coat and translucency.
- Optimized Glossy and skin rendering a bit.
- Changed the default location for the Lux scene and the rendered image to be the **Documents** folder, instead of the Desktop. The directory is based on a default kept in the configuration. No UI right now but you can change it by editing the .plist file on Mac or the Registry on Windows. The UI will be added ITP (If Time Permits)
- Fixed updating of light, including renaming
- New lights, if they are set to pure white, are now correctly set to use Color temperature, instead of RGB, for their color model
- Now materials that are not visible in render are not exported to Lux.
- Stability improvements
