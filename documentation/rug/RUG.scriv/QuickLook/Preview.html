<p class="binderItem"><strong>How to use this guide</strong><br/>This guide has several features that are meant to help you find the information needed in the fastest way possible. Since Reality works in the same way, regardless if the version used connects to [PS] or to [DS], there is a single edition of this guide. Whenever a feature is specific to [PS] or [DS], the text will clearly say so. Since several artists use both [PS] and [DS] having all the information about Reality in a single guide is also quite convenient. <br/>

- Run Reality and, optionally, edit some settings<br/>
- Render<br/>
 <br/>
###Create the scene<br/>
<br/>
First you create your scene in [PS] or [DS] as you would normally. Don't spend too much time setting the materials in the host as you will be doing all the fine-tuning in Reality. Setting the basic textures for characters and props is generally all that you have to do. <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rendering with a transparent background</strong><br/>If you want to replace the background of the image in post-processing you can do that easily in Reality by simply enabling the **Transparent BG** checkbox in the Output section of the Render tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rendering modes</strong><br/>Reality provides several options for rendering your images with optimal balance between quality and speed. Let's see all the options in detail.<br/>
<br/>
# "Scene Configuration Options"<br/>
<br/>
By default Reality renders using CPU acceleration. This mode gives you an excellent quality of image, while rendering as fast as possible when using the CPU and preserving the unbiased nature of the image. Compared to the previous version of Reality, this accelerated mode is between seven and ten times faster.<br/>
<br/>
We can ma...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Refine Brush tool</strong><br/>When using the non-accelerated rendering mode there can be scenes that have areas that take longer than others to be free of [render noise][Fireflies]. This situation usually happens in parts of the scene where there is low light or where the light's path can be obstructed. For those situations LuxRender has a handy tool: the **Refine Brush**. <!-- \index{Render noise} --> <!-- \index{Refine brush} --><br/>

<!-- \index{Reality add-ons} --> <br/>
###Mesh Lights<br/>
<!-- \index{[ML]} --><br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The render never stops</strong><br/>If you are not familiar with LuxRender, the above heading might seem a bit odd. LuxRender works by collecting light samples  in a endless cycle. <!-- \index{Samples} --> The renderer doesn't make the decision for us about when to stop; we stop the process when we are satisfied with the image. Many different factors can determine the time required for a satisfactory render. When we close LuxRender, the rendered image is saved on disk, in the image file that we have specified in the Render tab of ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>When is the right time to stop LuxRender? </strong><br/><br/>
Given that LuxRender doesn't stop automatically at an arbitrary point, you might wonder when it is the right time to stop the render. The short answer is "when it's good enough for you." Until you gain more practice with LuxRender it's impossible to give an answer to what is the acceptable level of quality, expressed in time. Each pass in the rendering process doesn't just refine the "grain" of the image but it adds quality to the light that is simulated. For example, glass reflections will loo...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The exported scene files</strong><br/>Reality performs its task by reading all the information about the host scene and then generating a scene file using the LuxRender language. After the scene file is created, Reality then calls LuxRender and points the program to the scene file generated. Rendering starts as soon as the scene file is read, the rendering image will appear on screen, and this image will be automatically saved to disk.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Best practices for exporting your scene</strong><br/>###Hide what you don't see<br/>
<br/>
LuxRender performs very demanding operations because it uses real-world mathematical models for calculating the effects of light and the behavior of materials. While often it's a good idea to render off-camera objects, many times you will save a considerable amount of time and memory by not exporting part of your scene that is not visible. <br/>
<br/>
For example, many scenes that use the DAZ human figures, like Victoria or Michael, pose the models with their mouths closed. In ...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Saving your Reality settings </strong><br/>Reality saves all your material configurations and other settings inside your [PS] or [DS] scene automatically. Once you save the scene file your Reality configuration is saved. When you reload that scene in [PS] or [DS] all the Reality settings will be loaded automatically.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tonemapping</strong><br/>After you play with LuxRender a little bit you will notice some controls in the main render window. The topmost is called *Tonemapping.* <!--\index{Tonemapper}--> Tonemapping is very important in making things work the way you want, and in achieving the look that you desire. <br/>

<br/>
You can stop a Reality-created render at any time, and close Lux. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Reclaiming disk space</strong><br/>After you run LuxRender for a while  you will see that several `.flm` files are created. Those files are used by LuxRender to resume the render. If you don't need to resume the render from where it stopped you can delete those files and reclaim some disk space. `Flm` files can be actually quite large, ranging from 20Mb to 80 or more than 100 Mb each. <br/>
<br/>
To find the `flm` file use your OS file search utility and then delete them. </p>

That's why machines cannot make art; the human touch is still, fortunately, necessary.<br/>

Lights in LuxRender have properties that cannot be found in  [PS] or [DS] and so this is the place where you can define all the properties of lights used in your scene. Most Reality lights are directly linked to their  host equivalent.

# "The Reality Camera Editor"<br/>
<br/>
The Camera Editor takes the list of cameras defined in the host and presents them in a list. By default the active camera in the host is selected in the Camera Editor. As you switch camera view in the host the Reality Camera Editor changes its selection. <br/>

You can change this behavior by explicitly clicking on one camera n...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Volumes Editor</strong><br/>Reality includes a flexible, powerful volume system that controls how light behaves when it moves through objects or the space in-between objects. <!-- \index{Volumes} --><br/>
<br/>
See [Volumes][] for a explanation of how volumes work.<br/>
<br/>
The Volumes tab in Reality allows you to create new volumes and to set up all the properties for LuxRender volumes. You can then attach volumes to materials, assigning them for the inner or outer portion of a material.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Careful with those light sets</strong><br/>While Reality can easily convert any [PS] or [DS] light set it is important to understand why you should avoid using light sets made for such programs.<br/>
<br/>
The lighting model of the [hrenderer] renderers and the one used by LuxRender are very, very different and use completely different approaches. In [PS] a typical light set from the library can use an IBL light in conjunction with a few [ILs]. [ILs] are almost never used in LuxRender. One single [IL] can cause severe over-lighting; two are a reci...</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Unbiased vs. biased renderers</strong><br/>LuxRender is a physically-based, unbiased renderer. If you are not familiar with these terms, it's worth spending a few seconds learning how they affect your work. Most rendering engines, including [hrenderer], are biased.<br/>
<br/>
What that means, in simple terms, is that we can drive the renderer to create effects that are not possible in real life. For example, in [hrenderer] we can arbitrarily decide if a light projects shadows and if the shadow is soft or hard. In real life, if we turn on a light, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Creating soft shadows with Reality</strong><br/>The sharpness or softness of the shadows is not based on the brightness of the light but on its **size**. For example, the Sun is a very small light source in reference to people and even buildings. Of course we know that the Sun is several times the size of the Earth, but because of the distance it appears as a point in the sky. During a bright sunny day shadows are sharp. If you were to create a [PS] or [DS] scene and decided to set the sun with soft shadows, while visibly showing an outdoor, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Lights are visible</strong><br/>In many 3D applications, [PS] and [DS] included, it is possible to place a light in view of the camera and then set it to be invisible during rendering. This is not possible in LuxRender, and this is a very good thing. <br/>
<br/>
Hiding lights during rendering is a time-honored technique used by conventional renderers because it was often necessary to use  several lights to simulate ambient light. Those lights needed to be placed in strategic points in the scene and they were often visible by the camera....</p>

<ul>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Reality materials are simpler</strong><br/>When you look at the properties of the Reality materials they seem a lot simpler than both the [PS] versions and the [DS] versions. In [PS] you might find a long list of nodes linked together. In [DS] you might find a long list of shader properties spanning several screen lengths.<br/>
<br/>
Reality materials are defined by their characteristics, like being Velvet, Metal or Glass. Those characteristics in many cases include multiple parameters in a traditional renderer that may not be necessary for an unb...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Textures</strong><br/><!-- \index{Textures} --><br/>
A texture is a pattern that is projected on a surface. At the very simplest the "pattern" can be a solid color. <br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, in the [PS] and [DS] world the term texture has been equated to an image. That is actually not correct. This book uses the term "texture" to indicate a generic pattern projected on a surface. We will use the expression "image map" to indicate a texture based on an image. <br/>
<br/>
Textures are divided into a few different subcategories. There are, for...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Material Editor</strong><br/>The main component of the Reality UI is the material editor. Reality automatically converts all the elements in your scene, like materials, lights and cameras to corresponding elements in LuxRender. For example, a shiny object is converted to the LuxRender *Glossy* material, others are converted to *Matte* and so on. Reality automatically recognizes the materials for most popular figures.  For example, the face material is converted to Skin <!-- \index{Material!Skin} -->and the cornea is convert...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Material channels</strong><br/>Materials are made of several "channels," inputs that define some properties of the material. The combination of all the channels produces the final result. The channels have specific names and this section is meant to give a quick overview of the role of each channel.<br/>
<br/>
- **Diffuse.** This channel gives the basic color of a surface. It can be a solid color or an image map or a combination of several elements. The end result is to provide the color, or colors, of the surface. While it's called "D...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sub-Surface Scattering (SSS)</strong><br/>Sub-Surface Scattering, or SSS, is the ability of a renderer to simulate the scattering of light happening in the layers of human tissue under the surface of the skin. SSS is used for several types of materials, but skin is its most popular application. <!-- \index{SSS} --><br/>
<br/>
Reality has a feature called "zero-click SSS" which assigns a *Skin* material, with SSS enabled, automatically to certain materials that are found in the the host's figure. For example, the material **1_SkinFace** of Victori...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Finding the right material</strong><br/>Sometime it might not be totally clear which material is which, based on the simple name. To make it easy to find a material, Reality selects the material in its list when the corresponding one is selected in the host. <br/>

- With the selection active right-click on any selected material<br/>

All selected materials will be changed to this new type. If you edited one material and you want to  apply those changes to a set of similar...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Multi-edit</strong><br/>Reality has support for multi-edit, the ability to edit one or more parameters for multiple selected materials. Simply select multiple materials either via  Shift-Click or Cmd/Ctrl-Click (Cmd for Macintosh, Ctrl for Windows), and then change whatever parameter you want. For example, you can change the glossiness level of all selected materials.<br/>
<br/>
Multi-edit works also for changing textures, material types and texture values. All this can be done across multiple objects. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Material Sync</strong><br/>There are times when we want to make a group of materials to act like a material that we have changed but we don't want to replace all the textures. For example, we might want to synchronize all the materials to use the same glossiness values and bump map of a reference material but we don't want to replace the specular map. <br/>
<br/>
In that case using the copy and paste doesn't work. Using multi-edit can do a lot but we can't change the gain of the Diffuse map for a bunch of materials with multi-edit....</p>

Reality provides access to most of LuxRender's materials. Reality materials are designed to provide all the advantages of using LuxRender's physics-based materials but without the complexity generally found when using renderers of this kind.

Glossy has the following channels:<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Glass</strong><br/><!-- \index{Material!Glass} --><br/>
Glass is a simulation of real glass and it can create near-photographic results. Glass is mainly defined by the Tint and Reflection parameters and the Index Of Refraction (IOR). Reality includes dozens of IOR presets measured from real materials. For example, if you want to render an emerald you can find the exact IOR for it, 1.56, under the Gemstones preset group. The IOR does not change the color of the material, which needs to be modified manually. Glass has th...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Mirror</strong><br/><!-- \index{Material!Mirror} --><br/>
This material simply defines a mirror surface. The parameters include a color for the reflectivity. The brighter the color, the brighter the mirror. For example, if you define the reflectivity to be 50, 50, 50 (a dark shade of gray), the mirror will act as if the glass was tinted dark. Generally shades of gray work best for this parameter. The other parameters define the optional thin film (zero thickness will disable it), and the IOR for the film. These work exa...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Metal</strong><br/><!-- \index{Material!Metal} --><br/>
This material defines metallic objects that can have anisotropic reflections (see the Polish parameter, below, for a definition). There are several presets: <br/>
<br/>
- Aluminum<br/>
- Chrome<br/>
- Cobalt<br/>
- Copper<br/>
- Gold<br/>
- Lead<br/>
- Mercury<br/>
- Nickel<br/>
- Platinum<br/>
- Silver<br/>
- Titanium<br/>
- Zinc<br/>

These presets can be configured to have variable levels of shininess and they can be used to create other types of metal. For example, very shiny silver can be used in place of stainless steel. We ca...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Velvet</strong><br/><!-- \index{Material!Velvet} --><br/>
This is a great material  for clothes and other textile objects like drapes. In addition to the usual diffuse color and texture, similar to Matte, velvet includes a "Thickness" parameter. Higher values accentuate the velvet effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Water</strong><br/><!-- \index{Material!Water} --><br/>
This material is one of the most exciting features of Reality. Water allows you to create very realistic-looking water like you see in high-end 3D programs.  The parameters for water definition are:<br/>
<br/>
- **Tint.** The color for the water. Use it to create orange juice, wine, beer or any other liquid. Please render responsibly.<br/>
- **Ripple amount.** If this number is higher than 0 then Reality will create ripples in the final render of the material. Higher values for ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Null</strong><br/><!-- \index{Material!Null} --><br/>
Null is perfect for when you need to create special effects using the Volumes. A Null material keeps all the geometry information, polygons and so on, but the geometry is not rendered. This makes it ideal for creating a "fog box," where the internal volume creates the fog effect and the geometry itself is not visible. Since it's necessary to have a mesh to hold the volume then Null material is our choice when using Volumes. See [Volumes][] for more information.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Alpha Channel</strong><br/>The Alpha Channel controls the transparency of a material.  <!-- \index{Alpha channel} --><br/>

The values available are:<br/>

- Opacity/Map strength. Without a texture the value indicates the level of opacity of the material. A value of 1.0 means that the material is perfectly opaque. A value of 0.0 means that it's completely transparent. If you have an Alpha Map the value works in the same way but in conjunction with the texture. The value is taken directly from the host during the conversion of the m...</p>

You can load a bump map or a normal map in this part of the UI. Reality will take the bump map from the host, if one is used in the material's shader.  If you use a normal map you will have to notify Reality about this by enabling the Normal Map in the texture editor.<br/>

The parameters for the displacement map are similar to the ones used for bump mapping, and can be used in conjunction with those. Displacement mapping creates a real alteration of the rendered geometry.  **This parameter depends on the subdivision level**, which has to be increased to 1 or more. Higher values of  subdivision produce finer detail in the resulting geometry but require a much larger amount of memory. This could be an issue with computers running wi...</p>

Any Reality material, except for Null, can be made to emit light. This option is similar to the Ambient settings of [PS] and [DS]. In fact, Reality will enable this option if it detects that a material in the host has valid Ambient parameters. To determine if a material in the host is actually using the Ambient channel Reality looks at the **Ambient Value** and the **Ambient_Color** parameters. If **Ambient Value** is greater than 0 and Am...</p>

<br/>
Let's  consider, for example, when light traverses a body of water. The water absorbs the light at a rate that is proportional to the depth of the water. At higher depths light becomes dimmer and dimmer because it's absorbed by the volume of water. The LuxRender volumes simulate that kind of behavior.<br/>

While this conversion is done at the best approximation that is possible by a program, there are several situations in which we need to change those materials to fit specific needs.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Removing a texture</strong><br/>There are times when we want to remove a texture from a channel. Maybe the texture was converted from the host in an unexpected way or we might simply have a different idea of what's needed in that place. <br/>
<br/>
To remove a texture from a channel simply click on the gear wheel and select **Detach**. This option allows us to unlink a channel from an existing texture. The option is not always available for every channel. If you see it greyed-out it means that the channel doesn't support the unlinking o...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Using a texture multiple times</strong><br/>There might be times when we want to use the same texture in multiple places. Ideally we would not want  to create a duplicate and waste memory. That's where the **Use existing** option of the gear menu comes in handy. <br/>
<br/>
For example, after we define a bump map texture we might want to use the same texture for the displacement. Since both channels use the same type of input that is a very legitimate action. <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Automatic Preset</strong><br/>Automatic Presets load automatically when an object is added to the scene. This includes figures and props. There is nothing special to do to get these presets to work, Reality will automatically load them if there is a match. While other programs require you to remember and find where the presets might be, with Reality there is no need to do so. The presets are simply applied by Reality.<br/>

This is called a Universal Preset, because such preset can be applied to any material, regardless of what object was used to create it.<br/>

To create a video animation file you then need to assemble the frames using an NLE (Non Linear Editor) like Adobe Premiere, Apple Final Cut, or compositing programs like Adobe After Effects. Blender's video editor can also be used, which provides you with a zero-cost solution for video editing.<br/>
