\f0\fs24 \cf0 <!-- \\index\{Material!Mirror\} -->\
This material simply defines a mirror surface. The parameters include a color for the reflectivity. The brighter the color, the brighter the mirror. For example, if you define the reflectivity to be 50, 50, 50 (a dark shade of gray), the mirror will act as if the glass was tinted dark. Generally shades of gray work best for this parameter. The other parameters define the optional thin film (zero thickness will disable it), and the IOR for the film. These work exactly like their Glass counterparts.}
