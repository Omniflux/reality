Given that LuxRender doesn't stop automatically at an arbitrary point, you might wonder when it is the right time to stop the render. The short answer is "when it's good enough for you." Until you gain more practice with LuxRender it's impossible to give an answer to what is the acceptable level of quality, expressed in time. Each pass in the rendering process doesn't just refine the "grain" of the image but it adds quality to the light that is simulated. For example, glass reflections will look more realistic, and subtle sheens in the materials will catch elements from the surrounding objects. }
