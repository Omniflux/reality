\f0\fs24 \cf0 Sometimes we might want to create the LuxRender scene files without launching the renderer. In those cases we can enable the *Export only* checkbox and Reality will do exactly that. The scene files will be created as usual but LuxRender will not be started. We can then start LuxRender manually and use the *File | Open*  menu option to open the `.lxs` file and start the rendering process.\
