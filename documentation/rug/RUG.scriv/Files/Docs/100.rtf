\f0\fs24 \cf0 If you are not familiar with LuxRender, the above heading might seem a bit odd. LuxRender works by collecting light samples  in a endless cycle. <!-- \\index\{Samples\} --> The renderer doesn't make the decision for us about when to stop; we stop the process when we are satisfied with the image. Many different factors can determine the time required for a satisfactory render. When we close LuxRender, the rendered image is saved on disk, in the image file that we have specified in the Render tab of Reality. In addition, LuxRender automatically saves the image every three minutes while rendering.}
