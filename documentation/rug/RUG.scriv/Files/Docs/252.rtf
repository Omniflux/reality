\f0\fs24 \cf0 After you run LuxRender for a while  you will see that several `.flm` files are created. Those files are used by LuxRender to resume the render. If you don't need to resume the render from where it stopped you can delete those files and reclaim some disk space. `Flm` files can be actually quite large, ranging from 20Mb to 80 or more than 100 Mb each. \
\
To find the `flm` file use your OS file search utility and then delete them. }
