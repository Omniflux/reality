Null is perfect for when you need to create special effects using the Volumes. A Null material keeps all the geometry information, polygons and so on, but the geometry is not rendered. This makes it ideal for creating a "fog box," where the internal volume creates the fog effect and the geometry itself is not visible. Since it's necessary to have a mesh to hold the volume then Null material is our choice when using Volumes. See [Volumes][] for more information.}
