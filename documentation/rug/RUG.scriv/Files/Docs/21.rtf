\f0\fs28 \cf0 LuxRender is a physically-based, unbiased renderer. If you are not familiar with these terms, it's worth spending a few seconds learning how they affect your work. Most rendering engines, including [hrenderer], are biased.\
\
What that means, in simple terms, is that we can drive the renderer to create effects that are not possible in real life. For example, in [hrenderer] we can arbitrarily decide if a light projects shadows and if the shadow is soft or hard. In real life, if we turn on a light, that light will cause shadows. We cannot change that. And if that light is small, in comparison to an object, the shadow will be sharp. If the light is large, like in the case of a big photographer's softbox, the shadows will be soft. This is a law of physics that we can use to your advantage, and these "physically based" behaviors are the basis of "unbiased" renderers like LuxRender.}
