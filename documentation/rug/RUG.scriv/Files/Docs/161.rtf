\f0\fs24 \cf0 Reality renders using LuxRender, a physics-based renderer. [LX] is included in Reality and it is installed automatically when installing Reality.\
\
If you have previously installed LuxRender, as a stand-alone program, then the installation of Reality [version] will **not** affect that installation. You will be able to use that version of LuxRender with other programs, like Blender or Maya.\
