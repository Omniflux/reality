\f0\fs28 \cf0 If something unusual happens while using Reality, and you think that you found a bug you might need to find out what's happening "behind the scenes." \
\
Reality logs some events into a text file called `Reality_plugin_Log.txt` which is stored in your Documents folder. This file is automatically deleted and re-created once it reaches a size of twelve megabytes.\
If you open that file in a text editor you can find possible error messages that can explain if something unexpected happened. If you contact our tech support we might ask you to send a copy of the file to use to help us diagnose the issue.\
