- The James low-resolution model has an error in the mesh. The hip area has inverted normals, they point inside instead of outside. For this reason LuxRender will not render the hip area. This is an error in the mesh, not in Reality or LuxRender. As a simple alternative use the high-resolution mesh, which doesn't have this problem. Alternatively give the poor man something to wear.\
