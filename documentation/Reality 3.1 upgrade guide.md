#Reality 3.1 upgrade guide

This guide applies only to people who have installed previous versions of Reality. If this is your first installation of Reality 3 for Poser please look in the file called **Readme - Reality for Poser.rtf** or the file **Reality_Users_Guide.pdf**.

##Removing the previous installation
To install Reality you need to **completely** remove the previous version. Rest assured that there is no loss of data in doing so because all Reality data is kept in other places than where the program is installed. The Reality program and plugin are stored in the `Reality` folder under the `addons` folder of the Poser Runtime that is stored with Poser itself.

##Macintosh upgrade
 
On a Macintosh Reality is installed, by default, in:
####Poser Pro 2014
     /Applications/Poser Pro 2014/Runtime/Python/addons/Reality 
####Poser Pro 2012
    /Applications/Poser Pro 2012/Runtime/Python/addons/Reality 

See the figure below for an example of the installation path:

![Mac installation][]

[Mac installation]: /Users/paolo/devel/Reality/documentation/images/RUG_Mac_Installation-Files.png "Macintosh Installation" height=400px

For the Poser standard, non pro, the location is slightly different.
To upgrade your installation of Reality to the 3.1 version please follow these steps:

- Make sure that Poser is not running.
- Delete the Reality folder under the addons folder.
- Delete the installation of the Reality props and lights. Those files are just standard Runtime files and have been installed in a location of your choice. All the files from the Reality props and light must be removed. See below for a list of the files that were included in the Reality 3.0 props and lights.
- Install Reality 3.1 as explained in the Reality User's Guide, in the *Installing Reality* chapter.
