**The next level of realism for Poser is here.**

To create images of stunning realism we need to use a renderer that simulates light and material based on the laws of physics. Most renderers included with 3D programs don't do that.

LuxRender renders a scene based on the simulation of physics and the results are stunning. Best of all, LuxRender is Open Source Software and so it can be used at no additional cost.

Reality is the software that connects your Poser scene to LuxRender. 

Reality converts your Poser materials, lights and cameras so that you can render your Poser scene with LuxRender. Best of all, creating realistic images with **Reality is simpler than using traditional renderers.**
You can see how easy is to start using Reality in this video:
