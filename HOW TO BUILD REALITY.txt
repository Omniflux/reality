Howdy!

Thank you for looking at Reality. This project is quite complex to build. I haven't done it in 3 years so I'm going by memory here. Bear with me.

First of all, Reality is designed to be built on both Mac OS and Windows but I developed the project on Mac OS and so a few things are Mac-centric. 
This doesn't mean that you need a Mac to build it. It's just that it might be a bit easier to start with a Mac. 

Ironically, I recently switched to Windows. Life is weird... :)

TOOLS NEEDED
============

- CMake 2.8
- Qt 4.8 (see the repo reality-libs)
- Visual Studio 10 (Windows)
- XCode (Mac OS)
- Most libraries, Boost, ZeroMQ, SQLite, are included in the libs directory

+++++
a) Open Source QT binaries Online Installer: 1) Sign Up for QT.IO account 2) Install PATH changed from DEFAULT C:\QT to C:\bin\QT 
                                             3) Install following build tool chain: Default (currently QT Creator 4.11.1 + QT Creator 4.11.1 CBD Debugger Support + Debugging Tools for Windows
                                                + MinGW 7.3.0 64-bit + CMake 3.16.0 64-bit
                                             4) Accept Licenses' Terms 5) Menu Group: default
b) 
c) 

Qt is used throughout the project for both the UI and other services like containers. It's at version 4.8 because I never managed
to include Qt 5. As far as I know, DS uses 4.8 as well. This will probably change soon. 

I have made special versions of Qt to bypass a couple of bugs and to streamline the process. On Mac OS Reality is a fat binary, providing both 32-bit and 64-bit
binaries in a single executable. This should be probably changed to just include 64-bit support, since 32-bit apps have been phased out by Apple.

The binaries of Qt for both Mac OS and Windows are available in a separate repository: reality-libs. Clone it to your machine and then unzip the libraries and
copy them to a suitable location. You will need to change the makeproj and makeproj.bat scripts to point to the location of those libraries.

Compilation is done from the command-line. That is, Terminal in Mac OS or cmd in Windows.

With cmake 2.8 installed you run the script makeproj like this:
